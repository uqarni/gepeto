00:00:08:12 - 00:00:08:18
All right.

00:00:08:18 - 00:00:12:15
Today, we're and talk about unlockingcapacity in the recruiting process.

00:00:12:20 - 00:00:14:04
We're going to focus in on areas

00:00:14:04 - 00:00:18:04
like the hiring manager participation,the recruiting process overview.

00:00:18:14 - 00:00:19:20
And then also,we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:19:20 - 00:00:29:06
about what we define as success.

00:00:29:22 - 00:00:33:05
The four areas that we're reallygoing to dig into are the job alignment.

00:00:33:05 - 00:00:35:20
That means clearly definingthe requirements of the role,

00:00:35:20 - 00:00:38:12
making sure the role is alignedto our grading system.

00:00:38:21 - 00:00:40:13
Defining the three must haves

00:00:40:13 - 00:00:43:11
and the three would benice is an alignment to the competence.

00:00:43:23 - 00:00:46:21
We're also going to talk a little bitabout interview management, making sure

00:00:46:21 - 00:00:49:20
that you define your interview teamsat the front end of our process.

00:00:50:03 - 00:00:53:21
You communicate the focus areas for eachone of the interview participants.

00:00:54:15 - 00:00:58:01
We really manage to eliminate reschedulesas much as humanly possible

00:00:58:04 - 00:01:00:17
and we provide actionable feedbackto our recruiting team

00:01:01:16 - 00:01:03:23
in the candidatelifecycle aspect of what we really want

00:01:03:23 - 00:01:06:14
to target a two weeklifecycle as much as humanly possible.

00:01:06:16 - 00:01:10:07
Now we understand, like sometimes happens,that business has changing requirements,

00:01:10:17 - 00:01:12:08
but if we average two weeks

00:01:12:08 - 00:01:15:12
across to all of our interviews,we will be setting ourselves for success.

00:01:16:02 - 00:01:20:03
We want to have a for maximumfor loop interview process

00:01:20:04 - 00:01:21:10
to align to the two weeks.

00:01:21:10 - 00:01:22:15
And then at the end of the day

00:01:22:15 - 00:01:25:10
where we need to have more participantsin that interview process,

00:01:25:15 - 00:01:27:19
it may be necessaryto align them to panels

00:01:27:24 - 00:01:30:04
to keep it to a two week for loop maximum.

00:01:31:03 - 00:01:33:10
Also, we wanted to find ourselves,you know,

00:01:33:10 - 00:01:38:10
what is the 24 hour feedback loop, 48hours, calls to action and any other sales

00:01:38:10 - 00:01:41:15
that are mutually identified betweenrecruiting and its business partner.

00:01:42:14 - 00:01:46:23
Now we're going to talk a little bitabout the recruiting process itself.

00:01:47:04 - 00:01:50:00
In this workflow,you'll see that it starts at step one.

00:01:50:08 - 00:01:52:23
Step one really is the openingof the requisition.

00:01:53:05 - 00:01:56:12
Now, it's important for everyoneto understand that the head count process

00:01:56:22 - 00:01:59:13
is a processthat happens separate from recruiting.

00:01:59:19 - 00:02:01:02
That means you work with your h.r.

00:02:01:02 - 00:02:05:11
Business partner to identify headcountrequirements, whether it be backfill

00:02:05:14 - 00:02:10:01
for someone that has left the company netnew incremental ads for a new headcount

00:02:10:01 - 00:02:13:17
that wasn't originally forecastedand budgeted or the repurposing

00:02:13:17 - 00:02:16:05
of an additional existing roleinto another purpose.

00:02:16:17 - 00:02:20:10
In all cases that has to go throughan approval process that h.r.

00:02:20:10 - 00:02:22:14
Business partnerwill help you kick off that process.

00:02:22:23 - 00:02:26:21
You will then manage that processthrough finance, through your team

00:02:26:21 - 00:02:33:05
leaders approval and then ultimately upthrough the chief human resource officer,

00:02:33:14 - 00:02:37:03
the chief financial officerand the CEO of the company.

00:02:37:06 - 00:02:38:04
Now be prepared.

00:02:38:04 - 00:02:40:22
This process may take up to 2 to 4 weeks,

00:02:41:13 - 00:02:44:07
dependingon the specific circumstances of the role.

00:02:44:20 - 00:02:45:16
The reason why I'm calling

00:02:45:16 - 00:02:46:08
that out here is

00:02:46:08 - 00:02:49:06
I want to understand recruitingreally doesn't play any role on that.

00:02:49:11 - 00:02:51:14
That is a handle entirely between H.R.

00:02:51:15 - 00:02:55:23
finance and your your leadership teamfor your particular department.

00:02:55:23 - 00:02:59:20
Where we do play a role is oncefinance issues a rec ID number

00:03:00:03 - 00:03:02:17
that tells usthe rule is approved and funded.

00:03:02:17 - 00:03:06:13
Once that role is funded,that information is sent to the group

00:03:06:13 - 00:03:09:15
manager for talent acquisition,either technical or non-technical.

00:03:10:08 - 00:03:14:00
That person will open up the role in draftmode in our job site.

00:03:14:07 - 00:03:17:05
Talent acquisition system,and from there, notify

00:03:17:05 - 00:03:19:14
the recruiter that the role is readyfor engagement.

00:03:20:07 - 00:03:22:22
Once that engagement happenswith the hiring manager,

00:03:22:22 - 00:03:26:00
we'll go into a little bit more detailabout what that engagement really means.

00:03:26:16 - 00:03:29:19
The recruiter in the source will beginsourcing and selecting candidates

00:03:29:19 - 00:03:31:08
for our top of funnel process.

00:03:31:08 - 00:03:35:01
That top of funnel process is really justputting candidates that appear

00:03:35:01 - 00:03:40:08
to be qualified from our various sourceslike LinkedIn referrals, active applicants

00:03:40:16 - 00:03:44:11
into a queue to be screened, reviewedand screened by the recruiting team.

00:03:44:22 - 00:03:48:18
Once that recruiting team in steptwo has reviewed and potentially screened,

00:03:49:00 - 00:03:52:05
qualified candidateswill then move on to step three.

00:03:52:11 - 00:03:56:23
Step three is the interview process,and it is probably the most likely process

00:03:56:23 - 00:03:59:00
out of all five of these steps.

00:03:59:00 - 00:04:03:17
The interview process really needs to beconstrained to a roughly approximately

00:04:03:17 - 00:04:07:24
a two week window for corporate techand not higher tech hires.

00:04:08:12 - 00:04:11:03
The six week process for thefor the high volume

00:04:11:03 - 00:04:14:23
interview process reallyis more aligned to hiring of classes.

00:04:14:23 - 00:04:16:21
And you'll see some information thereon the right hand

00:04:16:21 - 00:04:19:17
side about those constraintsand those guidelines.

00:04:20:02 - 00:04:23:04
We're going to focus in on the corporatetech and non-tech process today.

00:04:23:17 - 00:04:25:08
There are four interview loops.

00:04:25:08 - 00:04:28:08
The first one is the recruiter screen,which happens in step two.

00:04:28:14 - 00:04:30:23
The second one is the hiring managerinterview.

00:04:31:01 - 00:04:34:02
The third one is the tech interview,assessment and craft.

00:04:34:10 - 00:04:38:00
Now, steps two and three are dynamicand they can happen in any order.

00:04:38:00 - 00:04:41:01
And we built that specificallyfor flexibility for the business

00:04:41:10 - 00:04:43:16
because every part of the businessmay have a different need.

00:04:44:04 - 00:04:45:21
The fourth step is the final round.

00:04:45:21 - 00:04:48:24
That final round may also bea single interview with an individual.

00:04:48:24 - 00:04:51:00
It may be a panel interviewwith a group of people.

00:04:51:00 - 00:04:53:23
It may be a craft or presentationassessment.

00:04:53:23 - 00:04:57:12
In any case, that is the final stepof the process prior to decision.

00:04:58:03 - 00:05:00:23
Now, when the interview process kicks off,

00:05:00:24 - 00:05:04:17
that recruiter sends the hiring managerthe candidate through job.

00:05:04:21 - 00:05:07:02
It will be a presentationmade through the system

00:05:07:02 - 00:05:08:19
that says with a link to the candidate

00:05:08:19 - 00:05:11:00
resume, saying,Please review this candidate.

00:05:11:00 - 00:05:14:13
You have access to the recruiter notesand feedback of why they feel like

00:05:14:13 - 00:05:15:16
this is a good candidate.

00:05:15:16 - 00:05:19:08
Because let's be honest, not everyone'sresume calls up all of their capabilities,

00:05:19:18 - 00:05:22:15
and not every person writesa great resume.

00:05:22:17 - 00:05:25:18
So be mindful that you should alsotake a look at your recruiter notes

00:05:25:18 - 00:05:29:03
as well in determining if this individualis ready to move forward for interview.

00:05:29:22 - 00:05:32:23
Once the hiring manager selectsa candidate for interview and advises

00:05:32:23 - 00:05:34:13
the interview teamthat they're entering someone

00:05:34:13 - 00:05:37:21
into process, the recruiterwill hand this off to the coordinator.

00:05:38:10 - 00:05:42:09
The coordination team will work closelywith the candidate, with the recruiter,

00:05:42:15 - 00:05:43:24
and with the interviewer

00:05:43:24 - 00:05:47:02
to ensure that we schedulethese interviews in a timely manner.

00:05:47:10 - 00:05:51:11
Again, our target is 48 hoursfrom the time of the request is initiated

00:05:51:11 - 00:05:52:24
to the completion of the interview.

00:05:52:24 - 00:05:55:00
As much as humanly possible.

00:05:55:16 - 00:05:58:11
All candidate transactions will happenwithin job site.

00:05:58:11 - 00:06:00:09
That means scheduling.

00:06:00:09 - 00:06:01:22
That means interview feedback.

00:06:01:22 - 00:06:04:24
That means presentation of the candidateand anything related to that.

00:06:05:07 - 00:06:09:20
We can use Slack to coordinate schedules,but no candidate information,

00:06:09:20 - 00:06:12:22
no interview feedback,nothing relative to that candidate's

00:06:13:02 - 00:06:16:04
individual candidacyshould be housed within Slack.

00:06:16:05 - 00:06:18:06
We should be using that within job site.

00:06:18:06 - 00:06:21:07
The employment and interviewprocess is a confidential process

00:06:21:07 - 00:06:22:24
and we need to havecertain controls in place.

00:06:24:18 - 00:06:27:00
Once thathiring manager conducts their interview,

00:06:27:00 - 00:06:31:01
then they will move on to the tech screenor vice versa, whichever comes first

00:06:31:08 - 00:06:34:11
as that candidate progressesthrough the various interview stages,

00:06:34:11 - 00:06:38:16
every interviewer has an interviewfocus area that they're assigned to.

00:06:38:22 - 00:06:41:23
They need to ask questionsrelative to that focus area

00:06:41:23 - 00:06:43:20
against the requirements of the role.

00:06:43:20 - 00:06:47:17
And then once that interview is completed,provide timely and actionable feedback

00:06:47:17 - 00:06:52:03
in the job site system for that recruiterand or source, or to review and act upon.

00:06:52:03 - 00:06:55:07
Especially if we are saying the candidateis not ready to move forward.

00:06:55:14 - 00:06:59:14
It's critical and imperativethat the recruiter understand why

00:06:59:21 - 00:07:01:02
they're not moving forward.

00:07:01:02 - 00:07:05:06
What were the gaps in capabilitiesor soft skills and how that recruiter

00:07:05:07 - 00:07:07:22
can best bridge those gapsin their next round of sourcing?

00:07:08:13 - 00:07:11:22
If the answer isthis candidate is successful and continues

00:07:11:22 - 00:07:14:21
to move through steps two or threeand then ultimately into four,

00:07:15:02 - 00:07:16:19
once they hit step four,

00:07:16:19 - 00:07:20:12
it's critical that the recruiter make surethat the hiring manager is keenly aware

00:07:20:13 - 00:07:23:12
of everything that will be necessaryto close this candidate

00:07:23:21 - 00:07:27:16
if that candidate successfully completestep four, which is the final round

00:07:27:16 - 00:07:31:01
and then ultimately the decisionfor offer, that means understanding

00:07:31:02 - 00:07:34:23
compensation, expectationaround location, working hours and so on.

00:07:35:05 - 00:07:38:01
If there's anythingthat falls outside our normal guardrails,

00:07:38:01 - 00:07:40:14
then it is imperativeupon that hiring manager

00:07:40:19 - 00:07:43:23
to potentially have an advancedconversation with their key team member

00:07:44:04 - 00:07:46:13
to determineif the team member would agree

00:07:46:13 - 00:07:49:02
to these exceptionsor these circumstances,

00:07:49:10 - 00:07:52:13
all things being equal,if this individual successfully completes

00:07:52:13 - 00:07:55:23
round four, it really doesn't do usany good to complete the final round.

00:07:55:23 - 00:07:57:06
If at the end of the day, no one's

00:07:57:06 - 00:08:01:20
going to approve the package necessaryto secure the candidate's signature, once

00:08:01:20 - 00:08:04:20
that Final Round interview is complete,there are two potential options.

00:08:05:01 - 00:08:07:11
One is to hire,and the other one is to not hire.

00:08:07:18 - 00:08:10:07
In both circumstances,we want to make sure that candidate

00:08:10:07 - 00:08:11:20
has a great experience.

00:08:11:20 - 00:08:17:01
If the decision is to not hire, butpotentially to hire in the future, perhaps

00:08:17:01 - 00:08:19:20
the candidate skill sets are not exactlywhere they need to be today.

00:08:20:04 - 00:08:24:00
Perhaps the individual needs some ramping,or at the end of the day,

00:08:24:13 - 00:08:27:15
we just don't have the appropriate rolefor them in all circumstances.

00:08:27:15 - 00:08:30:21
We want to make sure that when we releasethat candidate from the process,

00:08:30:21 - 00:08:34:08
we do it in a respectful,positive way for two reasons.

00:08:34:08 - 00:08:36:16
One, we may want them to come backin the process again

00:08:36:16 - 00:08:40:04
at some point in the future, andwe want them to be open to that idea, too.

00:08:40:04 - 00:08:41:21
We want them to be out theretalking about what

00:08:41:21 - 00:08:44:01
a great experiencethey have with legal Zoom.

00:08:44:01 - 00:08:47:22
For every positive experience a candidatewill tell anywhere from 2 to 3 people,

00:08:48:09 - 00:08:51:11
from every bad experience,a candidate have, studies have shown

00:08:51:19 - 00:08:54:15
they will share that informationwith 10 to 15 people.

00:08:54:15 - 00:08:55:08
So at the end of the day,

00:08:55:08 - 00:08:58:07
we want to protect our employer brandas much as humanly possible.

00:08:58:21 - 00:09:01:08
That's if we choose, not to move forwardthen individual.

00:09:01:14 - 00:09:04:06
Let's talk about when we want to moveforward with an individual.

00:09:04:17 - 00:09:08:02
When we choose to move forwardto offer the hiring manager, we'll work

00:09:08:02 - 00:09:11:14
with the recruiter in the group talentacquisition manager to build a package

00:09:11:14 - 00:09:13:02
that is attractive to the candidate

00:09:13:02 - 00:09:15:03
based on the informationthey have up to that point

00:09:15:08 - 00:09:18:01
and based on the guidelineswe have from our competence,

00:09:18:12 - 00:09:21:15
there are things like annual salary bonus,

00:09:22:19 - 00:09:24:13
restricted stock units and potential

00:09:24:13 - 00:09:28:00
signing bonuses are all tools that we haveavailable to us for consideration.

00:09:28:11 - 00:09:30:20
We will also be looking at thingslike internal equity,

00:09:30:21 - 00:09:34:16
making sure that the new hires alignto the internal bands of the organization

00:09:34:16 - 00:09:36:20
as well as to those outside compounds.

00:09:37:11 - 00:09:40:17
Once we make a decision to make an offer,we will

00:09:40:17 - 00:09:42:18
then move forward to the offer process.

00:09:42:18 - 00:09:45:17
Now that offer processhas both a transactional aspect to it

00:09:45:17 - 00:09:50:10
within our system and a communicativeaspect to it, from the hiring manager

00:09:50:10 - 00:09:52:08
to their team leader,especially where we need

00:09:52:08 - 00:09:56:09
to step outside those guardrails in orderto secure that person's employment here.

00:09:56:10 - 00:09:56:18
Legal.

00:09:56:18 - 00:09:58:09
So if for whatever reason

00:09:58:09 - 00:10:01:02
they are outside the patterns,they have some unique circumstances.

00:10:01:02 - 00:10:04:07
Whatever the case may be,it may be necessary to have that pre

00:10:04:08 - 00:10:08:09
conversation with your team leader prioror final round again to ensure

00:10:08:09 - 00:10:11:00
that they will approvethat should the Final Round be successful

00:10:11:04 - 00:10:15:10
once that final round is successful,reconfirming with that team leader

00:10:15:15 - 00:10:18:16
that at the end of the day they arewilling to sign off in these circumstances

00:10:18:20 - 00:10:22:16
so that as the offer entersthat transactional system of job right,

00:10:22:22 - 00:10:26:18
it doesn't get hung up in someone's inboxsimply because communication was lacking.

00:10:26:18 - 00:10:28:17
And they're trying to understandthe context.

00:10:28:17 - 00:10:30:21
Context should always be providedin advance

00:10:31:02 - 00:10:33:18
as well as during that approval processas well.

00:10:34:08 - 00:10:37:18
The ask here is that once we completethe very last interview

00:10:37:18 - 00:10:40:11
of that final round,whether that be a group panel,

00:10:40:12 - 00:10:44:19
whether that be two people interviews,that second person interview ends,

00:10:44:19 - 00:10:49:06
whatever that last step of thatfinal round looks like within 24 hours,

00:10:49:06 - 00:10:53:01
we need to make that decisionif we wish to hire or to not hire.

00:10:53:17 - 00:10:56:20
Once we make that decision,it is then communicated to the candidate

00:10:56:20 - 00:10:58:08
in advance through our system.

00:10:58:08 - 00:11:03:06
Now steps one, two, three and fourare all about the candidate experience.

00:11:03:06 - 00:11:07:11
How quickly and efficiently andeffectively we move through that process,

00:11:07:11 - 00:11:12:04
remembering that candidateslook at their interview experience

00:11:12:04 - 00:11:15:16
as an indicator,as a key leading indicator, actually,

00:11:15:24 - 00:11:18:09
of whatit will be like to work at that company.

00:11:18:18 - 00:11:21:17
So if we take forever to move that personthrough the process

00:11:21:17 - 00:11:25:19
or it's a disconnected process with poorcommunication and scheduling changes

00:11:25:19 - 00:11:29:19
and lots of interruptions in that process,people will look at that

00:11:29:19 - 00:11:33:04
as a reflection on what the day to daylife in this company looks like.

00:11:33:13 - 00:11:35:12
So we want to be mindful of that.

00:11:35:12 - 00:11:37:00
We also want to be mindful of that.

00:11:37:00 - 00:11:39:13
There's nothing goodabout hiring the wrong person fast.

00:11:39:23 - 00:11:42:24
So while we want to be deliberate,what we want to be thoughtful,

00:11:42:24 - 00:11:46:17
while we want to moveexpeditiously in our process,

00:11:46:17 - 00:11:49:11
we don't want to do it in a waythat sacrifices our quality

00:11:49:15 - 00:11:52:10
and potentially opens up the doorto hiring the wrong individual

00:11:52:10 - 00:11:53:06
to the wrong role.

00:11:53:06 - 00:11:54:14
It's not fair to the candidate,

00:11:54:14 - 00:11:57:02
and it's certainly not fair to the teamthat we'll be adding them to.

00:11:57:12 - 00:12:00:04
So let's keep that in mind as you movethrough the recruiting process.

00:12:00:16 - 00:12:05:10
Again, steps one, two, three and fourare within a two week window.

00:12:05:10 - 00:12:07:19
Step five The Onboarding Process.

00:12:07:19 - 00:12:09:19
Now we're going to spend a minutetalking about onboarding.

00:12:09:20 - 00:12:13:01
There is a transactional aspectto onboarding where the coordinator

00:12:13:01 - 00:12:16:04
puts the people in the background,they send them all the onboarding

00:12:16:04 - 00:12:17:15
information, the documentation

00:12:17:15 - 00:12:21:10
to complete human resources, sharesthem into payroll to our ADP system.

00:12:21:18 - 00:12:24:07
All that information is completeon a transactional basis.

00:12:24:18 - 00:12:27:19
The part of onboarding that'sreally not called out specifically here,

00:12:27:19 - 00:12:31:13
but is just as importantand maybe in some cases more important is

00:12:31:14 - 00:12:34:11
what happens that person on dayone and beyond.

00:12:34:18 - 00:12:36:12
How do they integrate into the team?

00:12:36:12 - 00:12:38:04
How is that information shared with him?

00:12:38:04 - 00:12:41:08
Are they given the tools and resourcesnecessary to get their job done?

00:12:41:15 - 00:12:45:03
Are they being oriented into whattheir job is and what the definitions

00:12:45:03 - 00:12:48:02
of successfullook like over the next 3690 days?

00:12:48:12 - 00:12:51:23
This is where we really encouragethe hiring manager and the team

00:12:51:23 - 00:12:55:13
that they're integrating intoto put some thought together behind what

00:12:55:14 - 00:12:59:17
that first, first 90 days experiencewill look like for that new hire.

00:13:00:01 - 00:13:00:16
It really does.

00:13:00:16 - 00:13:04:02
There's no good to move them throughsteps, one through four in a very positive

00:13:05:13 - 00:13:08:24
and deliberate manner, only for themto get to onboarding

00:13:09:00 - 00:13:12:15
and potentially second guess their choiceto join the organization.

00:13:12:15 - 00:13:15:22
If they don't have a great onboardingexperience into the team integration.

00:13:17:07 - 00:13:20:13
So now we've talked about the processas an overview perspective.

00:13:20:19 - 00:13:24:03
Let's go into a little bit more detailabout two of the most important stages.

00:13:24:21 - 00:13:25:19
The first stage is

00:13:25:19 - 00:13:28:17
actually opening up the recand this is the recruiter engagement.

00:13:28:23 - 00:13:32:14
When the group talent acquisition manageropens up the requisition

00:13:32:14 - 00:13:36:09
that they receive from finance,they will put this into draft mode

00:13:36:09 - 00:13:39:05
and share this over to the recruiterthat will be responsible

00:13:39:05 - 00:13:43:08
for the recruiting and potentiallya source of the recruiter will receive

00:13:43:08 - 00:13:47:07
that information and schedule engagementwith the hiring manager within 48 hours.

00:13:47:14 - 00:13:51:07
It's critical that that engagement happenquickly and effectively

00:13:51:07 - 00:13:55:08
because the recruiting on that requisitionwill not begin

00:13:55:08 - 00:13:57:10
until that engagement is complete.

00:13:57:10 - 00:13:59:03
Now, let's be realistic.

00:13:59:03 - 00:14:02:13
If this is the fifth software engineerthat we've hired over the last 90 days,

00:14:02:19 - 00:14:05:12
there probably won't be a whole lotbehind that engagement

00:14:05:13 - 00:14:07:13
that is different from the previous four.

00:14:07:13 - 00:14:10:11
However, there may be some uniquedifferences that we need to be aware of.

00:14:10:11 - 00:14:12:04
Perhaps there's a unique skill set

00:14:12:04 - 00:14:14:22
they need to bring to the tablefor this one particular software role.

00:14:15:05 - 00:14:16:23
Perhaps there are some experiences

00:14:16:23 - 00:14:19:05
that they need to havethat will make them more successful.

00:14:19:11 - 00:14:22:00
Whatever that case is,we need to have that engagement.

00:14:22:00 - 00:14:24:03
And it's not just to define the role.

00:14:24:03 - 00:14:25:16
It's also to help define

00:14:25:16 - 00:14:28:18
who the interview team isthat will participate in this process.

00:14:29:07 - 00:14:33:15
So once that interview,once that engagement is established,

00:14:33:15 - 00:14:36:14
the hiring manager will determinethe requirements of the role,

00:14:37:13 - 00:14:39:06
ensure that the job description

00:14:39:06 - 00:14:43:00
provided aligns to our leveling system,which then aligns to our competence.

00:14:43:00 - 00:14:46:19
So what level of communication,of independence, of expertize

00:14:46:20 - 00:14:51:09
should we expect that a grade 11,a grade 12, a grade 13 and a grade 14?

00:14:51:15 - 00:14:53:16
Because those degrees of expertize

00:14:53:17 - 00:14:55:20
will be differentbased on that particular grade.

00:14:56:05 - 00:14:57:04
That job description

00:14:57:04 - 00:15:00:06
should align to the grade becausethe grade aligns to the competence.

00:15:01:12 - 00:15:04:13
You also make sure that the three musthaves are listed

00:15:04:14 - 00:15:08:04
in order of importance under the skillsection and the three would be nice.

00:15:08:06 - 00:15:10:23
Which follow, which are the thingsthat would be nice to have,

00:15:11:05 - 00:15:13:07
but ultimatelyare not absolutely required?

00:15:13:07 - 00:15:15:24
Or maybe one of the three would benice as would offset.

00:15:15:24 - 00:15:20:05
Perhaps one missing must havein all cases, anything more than six

00:15:20:05 - 00:15:20:22
requirements.

00:15:20:22 - 00:15:22:23
You're starting to createwhat we call a kitchen sink

00:15:23:07 - 00:15:27:00
and that's probably not an ideal scenariowhen sourcing for candidates,

00:15:27:00 - 00:15:29:12
because at the end of the day,most people can only do three things

00:15:29:13 - 00:15:33:08
exceptionally well and three thingsperhaps somewhat well.

00:15:33:08 - 00:15:35:16
And that'sbased on a number of different studies.

00:15:36:06 - 00:15:39:24
When you look at your interview teams,you want to make sure your interview teams

00:15:39:24 - 00:15:41:16
are clearly defined at the front end.

00:15:41:16 - 00:15:44:10
People know they're participatingon your interview team.

00:15:44:20 - 00:15:47:09
They arethey have the skill sets necessary to vet

00:15:47:10 - 00:15:49:05
the capabilities of a candidate.

00:15:49:05 - 00:15:50:15
And you've clearly defined

00:15:50:15 - 00:15:53:21
what it is you want them to look forin that interview process.

00:15:54:10 - 00:15:58:08
The interviews should also be balancedacross your team.

00:15:58:08 - 00:16:00:02
So if you have a team of ten people,

00:16:00:02 - 00:16:02:07
only two people are doingthe bulk of the interviews.

00:16:02:16 - 00:16:04:10
Let's understand why that's happening.

00:16:04:10 - 00:16:07:08
If we need to train more peopleon your team to be interviewers,

00:16:07:12 - 00:16:10:08
let's get them trained and ramped upso they can start participating.

00:16:10:17 - 00:16:13:01
Most people find the interviewingto be pleasurable.

00:16:13:01 - 00:16:17:01
We don't want this to be perceivedas a burden by your team.

00:16:17:08 - 00:16:18:04
At the end of the day,

00:16:18:04 - 00:16:22:16
building out your team and building outa bench of strong interviewers

00:16:22:23 - 00:16:26:08
will help make your recruiting processmore efficient and more effective.

00:16:26:21 - 00:16:27:23
We also want to drive

00:16:27:23 - 00:16:30:23
the timeliness of the processand really at the end of the day,

00:16:30:23 - 00:16:34:13
it is the hiring managers responsibilityin partnership with the recruiter

00:16:34:21 - 00:16:38:21
to make sure that that process movesdeliberately and efficiently.

00:16:39:03 - 00:16:42:01
Again, I want to reinforce the factthere is nothing good about hiring

00:16:42:01 - 00:16:43:14
the wrong person fast.

00:16:43:14 - 00:16:46:05
So moving fastjust for the sake of moving fast,

00:16:46:05 - 00:16:49:09
but not hiring the rightperson is really counterproductive.

00:16:49:15 - 00:16:53:07
When you have the right person or someoneyou think is the right person in process.

00:16:53:07 - 00:16:56:10
Let's be deliberate, let's be concise,and let's get that person

00:16:56:10 - 00:17:01:05
across the finish lineas quick as humanly possible.

00:17:01:05 - 00:17:03:15
Let's talk a little bit about interviewsin detail.

00:17:03:24 - 00:17:06:16
If you see the top left hand cornerthere, you'll see the participants

00:17:06:16 - 00:17:08:08
in this process are the recruiters,

00:17:08:08 - 00:17:12:07
the coordinators, the hiring managers,and then ultimately the interview team.

00:17:12:23 - 00:17:15:09
So the recruiters responsibilityhere is to coordinate

00:17:15:09 - 00:17:18:14
with the hiring team, the coordinators,and the candidate for all the interviews

00:17:18:20 - 00:17:20:17
by means of coordinatingand kind of being that

00:17:20:17 - 00:17:23:16
single hub of informationfor scheduling capabilities.

00:17:24:08 - 00:17:28:05
Challenges around communication skillsmean if they have special accommodations,

00:17:28:05 - 00:17:30:17
they requireas part of the interview process,

00:17:30:17 - 00:17:33:17
anything that's necessaryto facilitate those interviews.

00:17:33:24 - 00:17:34:24
The recruiter will work

00:17:34:24 - 00:17:37:17
with all these team membersto make sure that happens correctly.

00:17:38:03 - 00:17:41:17
The hiring manager ultimately will onlyinterview process with that recruiter.

00:17:41:17 - 00:17:43:19
That means that they're going to reinforce

00:17:43:19 - 00:17:45:22
the assigned areasfor their interview team,

00:17:45:22 - 00:17:48:10
and they're going to make surethat interview team shows up prepared

00:17:48:10 - 00:17:49:16
and on time.

00:17:49:16 - 00:17:53:11
It's critical that we take a few minutesprior to every interview review.

00:17:53:11 - 00:17:55:24
The resume is documentssome potential questions

00:17:55:24 - 00:18:00:03
we might want to ask about capabilitiesagainst that required skill sets,

00:18:00:09 - 00:18:03:09
and then ultimately familiarize yourselfwith that person's

00:18:03:09 - 00:18:06:01
background so that your interviewquestions are thoughtful.

00:18:06:12 - 00:18:09:16
They probe, they look for outcomes.

00:18:09:16 - 00:18:13:10
They look for measured successesthat ultimately afford you the opportunity

00:18:13:10 - 00:18:14:00
to determine

00:18:14:00 - 00:18:17:01
if this person has the potentialto be the right fit for the organization.

00:18:17:13 - 00:18:20:19
I can't emphasize enoughthat at the end of the day,

00:18:21:06 - 00:18:24:20
interviewing the personagainst the role and capabilities

00:18:24:20 - 00:18:26:10
and the skill sets is critical.

00:18:26:10 - 00:18:28:18
You're not interviewing themand comparing them to another person

00:18:28:18 - 00:18:30:07
that's already here at the company.

00:18:30:07 - 00:18:33:03
You're making your decision based onhow does their answers,

00:18:33:03 - 00:18:36:13
how does their resume alignto the documented skill sets necessary

00:18:36:13 - 00:18:41:10
on the job description,we want to make sure that the feedback

00:18:41:10 - 00:18:43:23
is providedwithin 24 hours of the final interview.

00:18:44:10 - 00:18:47:10
Sooner than that would be ideal,but at the very least, 24 hours

00:18:47:10 - 00:18:51:03
and it's documentedand it's actionable in job by actionable

00:18:51:03 - 00:18:54:11
feedback meansif the answer is no, the recruiter

00:18:54:11 - 00:18:57:05
and source or have a very clearunderstanding of why you're saying no

00:18:57:11 - 00:19:00:09
so they can pivot on their sourcingif the answer is yes.

00:19:00:09 - 00:19:02:12
But with some qualificationor potential gaps

00:19:02:12 - 00:19:05:10
that we need to be clear on as a teamthat we'd have to bridge them through.

00:19:05:16 - 00:19:08:20
Let's be honest and transparent about thatso that subsequent interviewers

00:19:08:20 - 00:19:14:10
might be able to dig into thata little bit deeper.

00:19:14:10 - 00:19:15:06
You also want to make sure we're

00:19:15:06 - 00:19:19:00
communicating working hours and alignmentto any West Coast team operations.

00:19:19:00 - 00:19:22:24
As you know, we are a West Coast company,but we are actually hiring nationwide.

00:19:23:10 - 00:19:27:02
And as we hire nationwide, we want tomake sure that people understand

00:19:27:03 - 00:19:29:14
if there is going to be any requirementsfor them to be available

00:19:29:14 - 00:19:30:15
during West Coast hours.

00:19:30:15 - 00:19:34:21
And if so, what that expectation lookslike over the number of days and so on

00:19:35:22 - 00:19:37:10
for the interview teams themselves,

00:19:37:10 - 00:19:39:10
these are the people otherthan the hiring managers.

00:19:39:10 - 00:19:43:10
Please show up on time and be preparedif you need to reschedule.

00:19:43:10 - 00:19:45:18
Do not simply decline the calendar.

00:19:45:18 - 00:19:47:14
Invite in outlook.

00:19:47:14 - 00:19:51:13
We ask that you get togetheryour hiring manager, the recruiter

00:19:51:20 - 00:19:56:05
and if possible the coordinatorinto a Slack channel and communicate

00:19:56:05 - 00:19:58:20
your challenge of why you won't be ableto attend that interview.

00:19:58:20 - 00:20:01:01
And the reason we askthat is because at the end of the day,

00:20:01:01 - 00:20:04:08
the recruiting and coordinating teamhas no idea what anyone else's

00:20:04:08 - 00:20:06:12
availabilitylooks like beyond their calendar.

00:20:06:12 - 00:20:09:18
We don't know who has any deliverablesnecessary in the next couple of days.

00:20:09:23 - 00:20:14:18
We don't know what people's capabilitieslook like from a deliverable

00:20:14:19 - 00:20:17:10
and a calendaring aspectother than what we see on calendars.

00:20:17:17 - 00:20:18:09
Let's be honest.

00:20:18:09 - 00:20:20:07
Some people block their calendars,

00:20:20:07 - 00:20:21:11
whether they have interviews

00:20:21:11 - 00:20:24:04
or appointments or interviews scheduledbecause they need that time

00:20:24:04 - 00:20:25:06
to work on things.

00:20:25:06 - 00:20:27:03
There's a lot of variablesthat come into play

00:20:27:03 - 00:20:31:11
that create more problems than they solveby simply declining the interview

00:20:31:11 - 00:20:35:09
without having a thoughtful engagementfor 5 minutes, a conversation in Slack,

00:20:35:09 - 00:20:39:11
or on a slight call to solve the solutionand get a substitute in place

00:20:39:11 - 00:20:46:00
quickly and effectivelyso that candidate experience is preserved.

00:20:46:00 - 00:20:49:09
We want to sell that candidateevery step of the way, and that means,

00:20:49:14 - 00:20:51:06
especially if you havea qualified candidate

00:20:51:06 - 00:20:53:15
in front of you, that you knowhas a high probability of success.

00:20:53:15 - 00:20:56:01
It's not just about figuring outwhat they can do for us.

00:20:56:01 - 00:20:58:17
It's about explaining to themwhat we can do for them as a company,

00:20:59:01 - 00:21:01:21
as a team, the interesting technologiesthey'll get to work on,

00:21:01:21 - 00:21:04:15
how they're going to helpgrow legal, zoom to the next level.

00:21:04:15 - 00:21:07:12
All the things that you as an interviewerwould find attractive

00:21:07:12 - 00:21:09:15
if you were interviewing for a roleat another company.

00:21:09:21 - 00:21:14:07
Remember, candidates still have optionsand choices, especially top level talent.

00:21:14:17 - 00:21:17:12
And to join an organizationlike Legal Zone,

00:21:17:16 - 00:21:20:12
they have to understandwhat sets us apart from everyone else

00:21:20:12 - 00:21:23:22
that's potentially pursuingmost candidates still today

00:21:24:00 - 00:21:27:13
have on average two or three interviewsgoing concurrently at any given time.

00:21:29:07 - 00:21:30:15
Once you saw that candidate

00:21:30:15 - 00:21:34:06
and once you provide your feedbackin the system, we want to make sure

00:21:34:06 - 00:21:39:14
that the hiring manageris keenly aware of your thought process

00:21:39:15 - 00:21:42:01
and your potential rampingand what that would take to ramp

00:21:42:01 - 00:21:43:24
that individual to the next level.

00:21:43:24 - 00:21:46:03
Once you define thosewith the hiring manager,

00:21:46:03 - 00:21:47:19
we want to make sure that we approach

00:21:47:19 - 00:21:51:00
all our interviews consistentlyin an non-biased manner.

00:21:51:08 - 00:21:54:09
That means, again,aligning that individual's resume.

00:21:54:11 - 00:21:58:13
The questions that you asked inthe interview are aligned to skills

00:21:58:13 - 00:22:01:01
and capabilitiesagainst the requirements of the role,

00:22:01:07 - 00:22:03:21
not matching themagainst another individual.

00:22:03:21 - 00:22:06:03
If you have any questions on this,please work with your recruiter.

00:22:06:09 - 00:22:07:23
They'll help guide youthrough that process.

00:22:07:23 - 00:22:10:07
We will also be rolling out interviewtraining companywide

00:22:10:14 - 00:22:11:16
over the next several months.

00:22:11:16 - 00:22:13:05
So if for whatever reason

00:22:13:05 - 00:22:15:16
you don't participatein that first round of training,

00:22:15:16 - 00:22:17:06
let the recruiter knowthat you're interested.

00:22:17:06 - 00:22:21:14
We'll make sure you we get your scheduleinto the next round of training.

00:22:21:14 - 00:22:23:16
Let's talk a little bitabout our recruiting model now.

00:22:23:16 - 00:22:26:20
If you look at the typical bell shapedcurve that reside with most companies,

00:22:26:20 - 00:22:30:12
you have about 25% of your populationthat's entry level,

00:22:30:12 - 00:22:33:17
you have about 25% of your populationthat's very senior.

00:22:33:24 - 00:22:36:18
And the middle or the higherpart of that bell shaped curve or what

00:22:36:18 - 00:22:40:04
we call your career level, is that youryour staff and your senior staff level

00:22:40:04 - 00:22:44:02
roles, much like the existing populationand most large companies.

00:22:44:02 - 00:22:46:02
This is how we should approach our hiring.

00:22:46:02 - 00:22:49:00
And I'll tell you a little bit why,if you look at the left hand side,

00:22:49:00 - 00:22:53:00
they're at 25% hiring goalsfor growth model.

00:22:53:00 - 00:22:55:18
The growth model is capabilityof 0 to 25%.

00:22:56:00 - 00:22:58:05
These are typically entry levelright out of college

00:22:58:05 - 00:23:00:03
or maybe out of collegewith a year of experience.

00:23:00:03 - 00:23:03:23
So some intern background, this,they have a shorter arc to hire.

00:23:03:23 - 00:23:05:14
I mean, they hire more quickly.

00:23:06:15 - 00:23:08:12
This helps us build an internal pipeline,

00:23:08:12 - 00:23:12:19
especially for more challenging rolesto fill in the open market.

00:23:12:19 - 00:23:14:13
So where we have specific roles

00:23:14:13 - 00:23:18:06
that we need as a companythat are in high demand everywhere else,

00:23:18:15 - 00:23:21:10
we are more effectivein building an internal pipeline

00:23:21:10 - 00:23:24:18
from that entry level to that mid-levelthan we are going to market.

00:23:24:18 - 00:23:26:22
Every timewe need to hire a mid-level individual,

00:23:27:23 - 00:23:30:15
they are more open to learningbecause they don't have as many years

00:23:30:15 - 00:23:34:03
of experience and don't have as manyas much background on the companies

00:23:34:03 - 00:23:37:02
to synthesize and integrate intoand this way of doing things.

00:23:37:11 - 00:23:40:23
And quite frankly, they come at a betteralignment to our cost model.

00:23:41:16 - 00:23:43:02
At the other end of the spectrum,

00:23:43:02 - 00:23:45:16
the other 25%are what we call the buy model.

00:23:45:16 - 00:23:49:23
Now there are times where you do need thatperson to walk through the door on day

00:23:49:23 - 00:23:53:24
one to be nearly 100% of what you needand start contributing it on day

00:23:54:00 - 00:23:57:16
one and start relievingpain as quickly as humanly possible.

00:23:58:09 - 00:24:01:11
The thing to remember hereis that these generally are advanced

00:24:01:11 - 00:24:03:00
career level individuals.

00:24:03:00 - 00:24:05:04
They typically have a longer arc to hire.

00:24:05:04 - 00:24:07:08
We're talking somewherenorth of four months.

00:24:08:00 - 00:24:09:16
They can hit the ground running.

00:24:09:16 - 00:24:10:23
But at the end of the day,

00:24:11:22 - 00:24:12:18
given their senior

00:24:12:18 - 00:24:16:05
level, they are less proneto making quick decisions or moving more,

00:24:16:05 - 00:24:19:02
more frequently than someonethat's at a grow or rent model.

00:24:19:10 - 00:24:22:03
And quite frankly, they know their worthand will come at a premium.

00:24:22:11 - 00:24:25:04
So as you look at the challengesthat you're trying to solve

00:24:25:04 - 00:24:28:15
with your business, understandwhich one of these potential models

00:24:29:01 - 00:24:31:17
has the ability to serve your needs.

00:24:32:24 - 00:24:35:22
The model in the middle calledthe ramp model, these are individuals

00:24:35:22 - 00:24:40:04
that bring 50 to 75% of what you'relooking for from a capability perspective,

00:24:40:14 - 00:24:43:13
these tend to be mid to mid senior levelcareers.

00:24:43:13 - 00:24:46:09
Those staffs,the senior senior staff level roles

00:24:46:20 - 00:24:51:08
there is a moderate arc to hire anywherefrom, say, 2 to 3 months, sometimes

00:24:51:09 - 00:24:53:22
four months, just kind of dependingon the nature of the role.

00:24:55:08 - 00:24:56:07
But the question you have to

00:24:56:07 - 00:25:00:18
ask yourself is, in the timeit takes me to hire this 100% person

00:25:00:18 - 00:25:04:06
at four plus months, maybe six months,depending on the scenario,

00:25:04:21 - 00:25:08:16
is it more effective to bring in someonethat has somewhere around 75%

00:25:08:16 - 00:25:12:06
of what I need so they can start relievingsome of the pain for the team today

00:25:12:13 - 00:25:16:10
while we ramp them through to 100%in a shorter period of time than it does

00:25:16:10 - 00:25:19:06
to take to go to marketand buy a buy model person.

00:25:19:17 - 00:25:22:20
They will also come ina more realistic comp expectation.

00:25:23:05 - 00:25:26:19
However, at the end of the day, the choicechoices belongs to the business.

00:25:26:19 - 00:25:29:01
We're not telling you to sacrificequality.

00:25:29:01 - 00:25:31:11
We're not telling you to compromiseon capabilities.

00:25:31:22 - 00:25:35:01
What we are asking you to dois be realistic about your needs.

00:25:35:01 - 00:25:38:20
Would we all like to hire thatperfect person at the 100% capability?

00:25:39:03 - 00:25:40:06
Absolutely.

00:25:40:06 - 00:25:43:06
Can we always afford thator can we always wait for that person

00:25:43:06 - 00:25:45:12
long enough,that person to walk through the door?

00:25:45:12 - 00:25:47:16
The answer tothat is not always yes. Right.

00:25:47:16 - 00:25:48:10
So that's what we have to

00:25:48:10 - 00:25:52:06
look at that ramp model to understand,does this person have the aptitude

00:25:52:06 - 00:25:56:07
and attitude to learn in bridge and rampto 100% in a reasonable amount of time

00:25:56:13 - 00:26:00:11
faster and more effectively and more costeffectively than it would be to go buy

00:26:00:11 - 00:26:01:03
that person.

00:26:01:03 - 00:26:02:19
Only you as the service owner

00:26:02:19 - 00:26:05:00
and the business ownercan answer that question.

00:26:05:00 - 00:26:07:02
And your recruiteris going to ask you to consider this.

00:26:07:02 - 00:26:11:23
Every time we look at a highly highpotential individual.

00:26:11:23 - 00:26:13:20
All right.Let's talk a little bit about surveys.

00:26:14:23 - 00:26:17:01
The only way this two week model worksfor us

00:26:17:01 - 00:26:20:01
is if we have some more defined vesselswithin our process.

00:26:20:01 - 00:26:23:10
So if we're looking at an averageof two weeks across our entire process,

00:26:23:21 - 00:26:28:09
when we look at requests for informationrelated to the roles, clarifications,

00:26:28:09 - 00:26:33:03
updates to job description, resumereviews, interview feedback, obviously,

00:26:33:03 - 00:26:38:05
or calibrations on recruiting the askthere is a maximum 24 hour feedback loop.

00:26:38:19 - 00:26:42:00
Ideally, a shorter loop would be perfect,but where that's not

00:26:42:00 - 00:26:44:16
possible,24 hours should kind of be our benchmark.

00:26:45:05 - 00:26:48:04
The calls to action, let's be honest,will mostly be interviews.

00:26:48:04 - 00:26:49:23
But there will be timeswhere we need your help.

00:26:49:23 - 00:26:53:10
Closing a candidate,or we need you to discuss a

00:26:54:15 - 00:26:59:17
above mid-point or a potential comppackage challenge with a team leader,

00:27:00:02 - 00:27:02:12
whatever that action is for you to do,

00:27:02:20 - 00:27:06:08
we need you to try to completethat within 48 hours of the ask.

00:27:06:08 - 00:27:08:08
Now, we also understand as this happens,

00:27:08:08 - 00:27:10:08
we also understandwe live in the real world.

00:27:10:08 - 00:27:12:15
There are going to be timeswhere these assays are.

00:27:12:15 - 00:27:16:15
We exceed these isolatesbecause of the other business

00:27:16:15 - 00:27:18:22
we have to take care ofand we understand that will happen.

00:27:19:03 - 00:27:21:14
There are also timesthat we will beat these assays

00:27:21:24 - 00:27:24:17
much, much shorter windowsbecause we have the ability to do that.

00:27:24:17 - 00:27:28:12
What we're asking for all of us to dois to track towards an average across

00:27:28:13 - 00:27:31:22
all our interviews, feedbackloops of an average of 24 hours,

00:27:32:16 - 00:27:36:08
calls to action, an average of 48 hours,and then obviously a candidate

00:27:36:08 - 00:27:40:17
life cycle on average of around two weeksfor principal level roles and below.

00:27:41:07 - 00:27:41:18
Okay.

00:27:43:03 - 00:27:45:07
So let'stalk a little bit about the recap here.

00:27:45:07 - 00:27:47:18
So again, we touched on a little bitabout job alignment.

00:27:47:18 - 00:27:50:04
It's criticalthat you understand what you're hiring,

00:27:50:11 - 00:27:53:08
the level that they should be,that your job description is written

00:27:53:08 - 00:27:55:23
to that level,that that level aligns with the competence

00:27:56:10 - 00:27:59:02
and the part that I didn't call out here,but it's really important is

00:27:59:02 - 00:28:01:20
who in your organizationis ready for promotion?

00:28:02:06 - 00:28:05:16
So as you're looking at what you needand aligning to what you need,

00:28:05:16 - 00:28:07:18
let's make sure we look at team membersthat are ready

00:28:08:00 - 00:28:11:12
to rise to those challenges,maybe be stretched into those roles,

00:28:11:16 - 00:28:12:10
and then determine

00:28:12:10 - 00:28:15:12
what a potential backfill will look likefrom a promotion perspective.

00:28:16:04 - 00:28:18:20
We want to closely manageour interview process.

00:28:18:20 - 00:28:19:14
We want to make sure

00:28:19:14 - 00:28:22:12
that the interview teams are definedand aware that they're participating.

00:28:22:20 - 00:28:25:24
We want to make sure that we communicatetheir focus areas and that

00:28:26:13 - 00:28:29:20
they understand the value propositionthey're bringing to this team

00:28:29:20 - 00:28:32:17
and to the hiring managerwith the areas that they're focusing on.

00:28:33:01 - 00:28:36:15
We want to minimize and eliminatereschedules as much as humanly possible.

00:28:36:15 - 00:28:38:05
And where that's not possible,

00:28:38:05 - 00:28:41:12
gather everyone togetherSlack channel to communicate alternatives.

00:28:41:19 - 00:28:45:10
And we want to make sure that the feedbackthat derives from this interview process

00:28:45:10 - 00:28:49:04
is actionable and measurable so thatthe recruiting team can take that feedback

00:28:49:09 - 00:28:52:08
and decide how best to builda new pipeline of candidates

00:28:52:08 - 00:28:55:14
or better screen candidatesalready in process, or ultimately move

00:28:55:14 - 00:28:59:12
this person forward with potential cautionareas for the next round of interviewers

00:28:59:16 - 00:29:04:08
to potentially dig in to as they areas they participate in this process.

00:29:04:24 - 00:29:06:00
We want to keep that candidate

00:29:06:00 - 00:29:09:01
lifecycle to an average of two weeksand a maximum of four loops.

00:29:09:01 - 00:29:11:14
And where we have more peopleparticipating

00:29:11:14 - 00:29:14:14
than we have loops understanding,we may need to group those people

00:29:14:14 - 00:29:17:16
together on panelsto preserve that candidate experience.

00:29:17:22 - 00:29:20:17
Let's be honest, we've had candidatesdrop out of process here

00:29:20:17 - 00:29:22:11
at Legal Zoombecause at the end of the day,

00:29:22:11 - 00:29:24:15
they were able to enter processwith another company,

00:29:25:12 - 00:29:28:12
thoughtfully complete that processwith the other company, receive an offer,

00:29:28:12 - 00:29:30:00
make a decision in the same time frame

00:29:30:00 - 00:29:33:06
that it took us to get to step halfwaythrough step three of our process.

00:29:33:06 - 00:29:35:07
There have been cycleswhere it took more than a month

00:29:35:07 - 00:29:37:06
to get peoplethrough the interview process.

00:29:37:06 - 00:29:39:23
So again, we're not sayingsacrifice quality.

00:29:40:02 - 00:29:42:22
What we are saying islet's be deliberate in how we move.

00:29:43:17 - 00:29:46:10
And then the final sectionare the SLA making sure

00:29:46:10 - 00:29:50:00
that we are providing feedbackand as close to 24 hours as possible

00:29:50:08 - 00:29:54:01
that were rising to the occasionfor calls to action within 48 hours,

00:29:54:06 - 00:29:59:01
and that we're making a hiring decisionwithin 48 hour, 24 hours as well.

00:29:59:01 - 00:30:02:02
So as we look at thisrecruiting process overall

00:30:02:09 - 00:30:06:05
and we as we move our people through stepsone, two, three, four and five,

00:30:06:14 - 00:30:09:12
remembering that I knowthis kind of looks like a game board

00:30:09:12 - 00:30:13:07
and this was sort of done on purposeso that you can understand

00:30:13:07 - 00:30:15:10
how to move your piecethrough the process.

00:30:15:10 - 00:30:16:19
We are dealing with human beings.

00:30:16:19 - 00:30:18:15
We are dealing with peoplethat are interested

00:30:18:15 - 00:30:22:13
in advancing their careerand making that career choice to align

00:30:22:14 - 00:30:24:23
with a companythat aligns to their core values,

00:30:24:23 - 00:30:27:00
that will provide them opportunitiesfor growth,

00:30:27:00 - 00:30:27:21
that will introduce them

00:30:27:21 - 00:30:31:01
to interesting technologiesthat will afford them a voice, and what

00:30:31:02 - 00:30:34:05
the next evolution of this organizationwill look like and taking

00:30:34:05 - 00:30:37:11
that seriously as we engage with themat each step of this process,

00:30:38:21 - 00:30:40:02
there's nothing really

00:30:40:02 - 00:30:43:02
extremely new about thisexcept maybe for the time frames,

00:30:43:02 - 00:30:47:02
except maybe for some more guardrailsaround some of the processes in general.

00:30:47:02 - 00:30:50:03
This is the same process we followed hereat Legal Zoom for a while.

00:30:50:03 - 00:30:54:07
We've just put some clearer definitionsaround expectations and participation.

00:30:54:18 - 00:30:56:19
But if you have any questions,if you have any thoughts

00:30:56:19 - 00:30:59:08
or given any feedback, we want to hear,we want to know about it.

00:30:59:18 - 00:31:03:05
We will continually evaluatethis process every quarter

00:31:03:14 - 00:31:07:15
and at the beginning of every new yearto determine what needs to be updated,

00:31:07:15 - 00:31:11:17
what needs to be changed, and ultimately,what should we start doing, stop doing

00:31:12:01 - 00:31:15:12
and continueto do so at the end of the day,

00:31:15:12 - 00:31:18:17
your feedback will be criticalbecause you are a partner in this process.

00:31:18:17 - 00:31:20:22
This is a 5050 relationship.

00:31:20:22 - 00:31:23:01
Our job is to bring the candidatesto the table.

00:31:23:08 - 00:31:24:13
Your job is to screen

00:31:24:13 - 00:31:26:24
and make the right selectionsthat are best for you and the company.

00:31:27:14 - 00:31:29:18
Continue to give us feedbackon how we can do that better.

00:31:30:05 - 00:31:31:20
Thank you for your time today.

00:31:31:20 - 00:31:46:00
Have a good day.
